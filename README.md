# Methods-Resources
Resources created for various methods related topics and issues. I'm currently working on creating the OLS & MLE estimators using my own function rather than built-in R programs. Furthermore, I am working on compiling a respository of Monte Carlo Simulators for the various problems and features of the OLS and MLE estimators that will be available here. 

Once this respository is complete it will be available at my website as well.
